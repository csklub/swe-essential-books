# Software Engineering: Essential Books 📚

_**The canonical and partly opinionated list of books that every software engineer should read in their lifetime.**_

> I have unsuccessfully resisted the urge to give any form of categorization for these books since it won't be a perfect one. For readability, I yielded to providing an _approximate_ categorization, don't take any offense if something doesn't feel in the right place.
